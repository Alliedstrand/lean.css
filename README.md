**Waste minimization in website production.**

[Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) is a manufacturing
philosophy that encourages the identification and elimination of waste without
sacrificing production efficiency (and, hopefully, improving it).

This project supports a similar philosophy, but for websites that only require
minimal styling needs and, in fact, may be more efficient in terms of:

1. Increasing developer productivity.
1. Increasing information discovery efficiency for website visitors.

Lean.css is likely more appropriate for static websites than Single Page Applications
or other web applications that are complex in nature.

### Design Goals

- Light and dark theme support with high-contrast features for user-friendliness and accessibility.
- Support for all Modern Web Browsers and Internet Explorer 11.
- Small distributable size for lightening fast load times.
- Class use is kept to an absolute minimum with attractive default styling for native elements.
- No JavaScript is needed for the benefit of SEO and load times.
